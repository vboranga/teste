                    mighty

                <h1>The New Scania<br>Opticruise gearbox</h1>
                <p>And that’s not all – premium power needs a premium gearbox . Scania’s new Opticruise gearbox features
                    improved gear shifting in combination with better fuel consumption and excellent comfort. The new
                    range
                    of gearboxes are designed for both driveability and sustainability. The wider gear ratio spread and
                    fewer internal losses provides up to 1% fuel saving potential. On top of this higher uptime with an
                    oil
                    change interval of up to one million km. All this to ensure that your truck is performing – every
                    hour
                    and every day. The new Scania Opticruise gearbox is available for all V8 engines up to 660 hp.

                        <p>Scania’s new V8 proved to be so powerful in tests on uphill slopes that it had to be reined
                            in.
                            Here, some of the key project insiders recount some of the highlights from the development
                            of
                            the updated V8 and the new gearbox.</p>

                            crawls out of the forest. With the world’s strongest truck engine under his feet, Harri Aho
                            sets
                            off to the paper mill in Inkeroinen.</p>
